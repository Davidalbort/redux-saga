# `Introduction`

 *  This project was created with react js, creating the components with atomic design methodology, styling with module component format, handling the data flow with redux-react, and the asynchronous requests with redux-saga and axios for the API request. The styling was created with mobile first in mind, this was done without media query to avoid rewriting the styling code.

 * This app consists of bringing some characters from the Api Rick and Morty, for it generates a random number according to the amount of characters that has that database, then requests the information to the Api and finally renders all the information on the DOM. So that all this functionality happens, in the app there is a button called "Generate", when we click it the functionality described above will occur.




# `Development process`

* Read and analyze documentation (challenge)
* Learn how to handle redux-saga with redux.
* Create the CRUD services for the consumption of web services and perform functional tests.
* Sketch the application interface.
* Creation of components, containers and home page to structure the application with semantic HTML, all taking into account the Atomic Design methodology.
* The logic of each component was made with redux, creating the necessary actions to update the state, finally a provaider was created so that all the information is in the whole app.
* With redux-saga we managed the asynchronous actions that allowed requesting information to the Api.
* The design was made taking into account the mobile first, this proposal was taken into account to not use mediaQueri. 
* Creation of styles for components and containers with style module, in order to have a functional and aesthetic design.
* The necessary tags were added to have a good SEO performance.
* Some integration and untitle tests were performed on the components and containers.
* Finally the documentation of the respective App was done.
